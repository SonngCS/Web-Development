    <p>My name is Vitor, I'm a brazilian <i>Computer Science</i> student and I'm <b>desperately</b> searching for a job!</p>
    <p>A picture of myself, lying on my bed after one year of research related to A.I. and clustering algorithms: </p>

    <p><b>My set of skills are:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decisive thinking and good thought process (one new idea every 27.5 days!)</li>
        <li>Great knowledge and strong will to learn (Despair really can move mountains, as the saying goes, I think...)</li>
        <li>Putting an enourmous amount of effort into learning other languages, so that I can be bad at all of them at the same time (Portuguese, English and Japanese at the moment!)</li>
        <li>Having no will to talk to other human beings, but doing so anyway!</li>
    </ul>
